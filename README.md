IBM CLOUD PROJECT 

Problem Statement No.8- Nutrition Agent


The Challenge - In an era where health awareness is growing, individuals increasingly seek personalized
nutrition guidance. However, most existing tools provide generic diet plans, lack real-time adaptability,
and fail to consider a person's holistic lifestyle, cultural preferences, allergies, and evolving health
conditions. Furthermore, dieticians and nutritionists face limitations in scaling personalized
consultations due to time and resource constraints.
Generative Al presents a groundbreaking opportunity to revolutionize this space by enabling an
intelligent, interactive, and adaptive virtual nutrition assistant. By leveraging natural language
processing (NLP), multimodal understanding, and large-scale dietary databases, an Al-powered assistant
can generate dynamic meal plans, recommend smart food swaps, and explain nutritional choices-all
tailored to the individual.
This project aims to develop "The Smartest Al Nutrition Assistant" using state-of-the-art generative Al
models that:
Understand user inputs via text, voice, or image (e.g., food photos, grocery labels)
Generate personalized meal plans based on health goals, medical conditions, fitness routines,
and preferences
Offer contextual explanations (e.g., "Why is this food better?")
Adapt suggestions dynamically with continuous feedback
By integrating health data, food databases, and LLM-powered reasoning, the solution will bridge the gap
between one-size-fits-all diet apps and in-person nutrition counselling-delivering an Al that thinks,
learns, and cares like a real nutrition expert.
Technology - Use of IBM cloud lite services /IBM Granity is mandatory.
